                <h1> User Experience üë§ </h1>
                <p> For the user experience, I do not think that the arngren.net website would be suitable for any type of users.
                The layouting of the elements limits what the user can do on the website as it leads to confusions. If I would be using it as someone who wanted to buy
                their products, I do not think that I would push through with the purchase as the intermediary between me and the device does not pick my
                interest as someone who will be using the website. Experience-wise, the website cannot be clearly navigated as it is not very responsive 
                and accessible ‚Äî even for people without disability ‚Äî because the design is not consistent and cohesive that decreases user familiarity. I also observed that
                the contents are not readable as there are varying colors, inconsistent font styles and sizes, and the visual/content hierarcy is not emphasized. </p>

                <h1> Content ‚úèÔ∏è </h1>
                <p> For a typical e-commerce website, the contents of arngren.net have what normal store websites contains such as photos, description, and prices.
                However, the placing of the contents could possibly increase the confusion of the users as the placement of elements are unorganized. The photos 
                as well as descriptions are placed as if its placement is not thought through. I commend the usage of  borders, but it still does not make the website
                appear clean-looking. It segregates the contents from the other ones, but aside from that, it does not add anything that could enhance the 
                overall appearance of the websites. Also, there are too much contents in just one page that makes it super compressed and crowded for both desktop and
                mobile devices. Though navigations are utilized, its functionality is not maximized. </p>

                <h1> Grid Layout üìè </h1>
                <p> If the grid layouting would be rated, it would have have at least 3 out of 10 points. As I have tested on both my phone and the desktop,
                the items were scatteredly presented on the mentioned devices which makes it hard to browse specific items. Additionally, the mobile apperance of arngren.net
                is not rsponsive as the size of how much contents are shown remains somewhat similar to the desktop. The page is long which makes it too small that you need to
                zoom in first before you could see the descriptions and/or photos. As what I have mentioned on the content, the layout of the grids are not consistent in terms of 
                the percentage that each grid occupies, the column gap, and the row gap. Overall, the grid layout might exist in the website, but its functionality and goal is not
                maximized or not even utilized at all. </p>
