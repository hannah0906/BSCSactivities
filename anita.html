    <p> <strong> Anita Magsaysay-Ho </strong> (born Anita Corpus Magsaysay; May 25, 1914 â€“ May 5, 2012) was a 
        Filipina painter who specialized in Social Realism and post-Cubism in regard to women in Filipino culture. 
        Magsaysay-Ho's work appeals to Modernism by utilizing more abstract designs and styles rather than realistic approaches.
        She was the only female member of the "Thirteen Moderns," a standing group of Filipino modernist artists, and in 1958 was chosen 
        by a panel of experts as one of the six major painters of the country's history. The most famous work of Magsaysay-Ho are subject to 
        the beauty of Filipino women dealing with everyday issues. One of her sample work is shown below:</p>
